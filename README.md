The construction of bounded-degree plane geometric spanners has been been a focus of interest in the field of geometric spanners for a long time. To date, several algorithms have been designed with various trade-offs in degree and stretch-factor. Using JSXGraph, a state-of-the-art JavaScript library for geometry, we have implemented seven of these sophisticated algorithms so that they can be used for research in geometric spanners and teaching computational geometry. Our interactive tool can also be used by researchers from related fields to easily understand and apply these fascinating algorithms in their research. This tool can run on any modern-day browser. However, for the best possible rendering, we recommend using a Chromium-based browser such as Google Chrome.
